hello to my web page
to start the web page just
double click index.html and start exploring 
(hopefuly chroming , hahaha bad web browser joke)

some things i think you shoud look in to:
* in the home page - hover over the pic
* check out the links in the nev bar
* try to change the browser size and see how the top banner react

hope you enjoy it  :D
